take input from users how many nodes, If the no of nodes is n then the matrix will be of nXn.
take the input from the user for each router.
take input of netwo+rks in the format of a matrix.
2 for loop for i and j variable
if i and j are equal then the value will be 0
If there is no edge then print infinty
For which node you want to find the shortest path
output shortest path from n to all other nodes.

the output should be of size n array 
minimum value and index. by sequential search 
update the array after getting sorted vector
